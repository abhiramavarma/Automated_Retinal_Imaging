      <h2>About This Project</h2>
      <div class="about-content">
        <p>
          This project demonstrates an automated system for the early diagnosis
          of Diabetic Retinopathy and its potential links to cardiac and ocular
          diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
        </p>

        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>
          Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a common complication of diabetes that
          affects the eyes, often leading to blindness if not detected early.
          Recent research also suggests potential correlations between the state
          of retinal blood vessels and systemic conditions like heart disease
          and glaucoma. This tool aims to provide an automated analysis of
          retinal images to assist in identifying the severity of DR and
          highlighting potential associated risks.
        </p>

        <h3>Model</h3>
        <p>
          The system utilizes a deep learning model based on the DenseNet121
          architecture, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and fine-tuned on a
          dataset of retinal images labeled with different stages of Diabetic
          Retinopathy (No DR, Mild, Moderate, Severe, Proliferative DR).
        </p>
